Who am I:

I'm Began, and I have a passion to desgin software that I will never
(probably) ever really see come to life, because, you know, I wish days could
last 48h to do everything I have to.

================================================================================
Where am I:

I'm currently a student at "Universita' politecnica delle Marche" (Italy) in 
computer and automation engineering. Not a good student, but I have actively
partecipated in a good quantity of projects and competitions, and once I even 
had to attend classes on web exploitation.


================================================================================
I don't like CVs

they really ruin whats good about a person. If you want to get an idea of what
my capabilities are, just watch what's pubblic on this profile.
