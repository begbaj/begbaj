WHO

I'm Began, and I have a passion to desgin software that I will never
(probably) ever really see come to life, because, you know, I wish days could
last 48h to do everything I have to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE

I'm currently a student at "Universita' politecnica delle Marche" (Italy) in 
computer and automation engineering. Not a good student, but I have actively
partecipated in a good quantity of projects and competitions, and once I also 
had a to tutor newbie script-kiddies in web exploitation techniques.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT

Music, computers, programming, reverse engineering, exploiting, pwning,
tinkering, riceing, producing beats, and I don't remeber what else. 
But I'm not expert at any of the above, but I'm always looking forward on 
being better on what I'm already good at. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY

Because I have a passion for everything in the WHAT section. That's why.
Not for money, not for fame, but for getting that feeling you only get when you
finally make a project come to life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I HATE CVs

they really ruin whats good about a person(ality). If you want to get an idea 
of what my capabilities are, just watch what's pubblic on this profile, or 
reach me out on Discord (dyremoff).
