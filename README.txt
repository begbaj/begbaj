BEGAN BAJRAMI a.k.a begbaj or dyrem
--------------------------------------------------
WHO

Hi, I'm Began. I’m passionate about designing
software—dreams that I may never fully see come to
life. Why? Because I’m the kind of person who
wishes days were 48 hours long just to fit
everything in.

--------------------------------------------------
WHERE

Currently, I’m a student at Università Politecnica
delle Marche in Italy, pursuing a degree in
Computer and Automation Engineering. I wouldn’t
call myself an exceptional student, but I’ve
actively participated in numerous projects and
hacking competitions.
--------------------------------------------------
WHAT

Music, computers, coding, tinkering, activism,
hacking and really everything that makes me feel
like something has been done.
--------------------------------------------------
WHY

I don’t do it for money or fame. I do it for that
unmatched feeling you get when a project finally
comes to life.

--------------------------------------------------
I HATE CVS

CVs strip away the essence of a person. If you
