WHO

Hi, I'm Began. I’m passionate about designing
software—dreams that I may never fully see come to
life. Why? Because I’m the kind of person who
wishes days were 48 hours long just to fit
everything in.

--------------------------------------------------
WHERE

<<<<<<< HEAD
Currently, I’m a student at Università Politecnica
delle Marche in Italy, pursuing a degree in
Computer and Automation Engineering. I wouldn’t
call myself an exceptional student, but I’ve
actively participated in numerous projects and
hacking competitions.

I'm currently a student at "Universita' politecnica delle Marche" (Italy) in 
computer and automation engineering. Not a good student, but I have actively
partecipated in a good quantity of projects and competitions, and once I also 
had to tutor newbie script-kiddies in web exploitation techniques.

WHAT

Music, computers, coding, tinkering, activism,
hacking and really everything that makes me feel
like something has been done.
--------------------------------------------------
WHY

I don’t do it for money or fame. I do it for that
unmatched feeling you get when a project finally
comes to life.

CVs strip away the essence of a person. If you
